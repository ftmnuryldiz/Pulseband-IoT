The pulse, commonly referred to as the heartbeat, refers to the pressure exerted on the walls of the heart as it contracts and relaxes. It not only provides information about how many times the heart beats in a minute but also carries data about the heart's rhythm, whether it is functioning regularly, and other characteristics. The pulse rate can vary depending on age, gender, medication use, illness, body temperature, and physiological structure. In individuals who exercise regularly, the pulse rate tends to be lower (45-60 beats per minute). The lower your heart rate during rest, within a certain range, the better it is considered to be. (For example, smokers tend to have higher pulse rates.) A healthy adult's heart rate at rest is expected to range between 60-100 beats per minute (50-70: good, 70-85: normal, 85+: high).

Rather than temporary fluctuations in the pulse due to physical or emotional changes, persistent irregularities in pulse readings over time can signal potential health problems. In such cases, using devices like blood pressure monitors or pulse sensors to measure the pulse with pressure becomes more significant than traditional methods, such as measuring your pulse with three fingers on your wrist for a minute. A home pulse monitor can simplify such tasks and prove useful.
